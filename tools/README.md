# Info
A bunch of bash and other files/commands to do with working/developing/debugging on the platform prod and dev

# Setup
Some aspects are configurable (and required to be confirgured), so some scripts you must configure correct environment variables for it to know where to find certain platform related files/code/etc.
You'll probably have to do `chmod +x` for most of the bash files
